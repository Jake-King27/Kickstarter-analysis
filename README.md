# Kickstarting with Excel
Performing Analyis to determine how plays faired based on Launch Date and Goal 
# Overview of Project / Purpose
The overview and purpose of the project was to determine how plays faired based on the launch date. As well as the goal based on a range. 
# Analysis and Challenges
The first analysis was to see how theater outcomes are compared to the launch date. From this first analysis we had to filter on the date and provide the launch date after using the time formula. Based on the image below it appears that successful time was mostly during the summer months.
